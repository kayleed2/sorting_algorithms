# Big O and Sorting Algorithms

## The Project
This project is to implement various sorting algorithms and determine the time
complexities of their associated functions in the best, worst, and average
case scenarios.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone 
the following:

* At least four different sorting algorithms.
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm.
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input.
* What is a stable sorting algorithm.

## Creators
This project was contributed to, and maintained, by Kaylee Dao and
Adam Brummer.
